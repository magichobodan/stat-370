## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown doc shows the salaries of all Orioles players from 2003. One player made a massive amount of money.

```{r barplotofallbaltimoreorioleplayeysalaries2003}
barplot(baltimoreoriolesplayersalary)
```





Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
